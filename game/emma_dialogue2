YOU: Who was this anyway?
EMMA: Poor Silas.
Silas... That name does ring bell. 
You remember chatting with him at dinner.
You got on quite well.
You can't really remember any single thing he said, but you have the sense that you had a good time.
The splitting headache in your head says *something* about the time you had.
YOU: Silas... Silas, silas, silas.
You look at him. Lying there on the ground, books strewn all around.
YOU: You know, I have decided that Silas didn't deserve to die like that.
YOU: Not alone, in a shoddy library, and not without anyone ever knowing how it happened. 
YOU: Yes. I'm going to solve the murder and clear my good name. 
EMMA: First, he wasn't alone, you were clearly there. Second, this is quite a fancy library.
EMMA: Lastly, there is no muderer *to* solve. You clearly killed him.
YOU: Well... You... you don't know that!
EMMA: Can *you* tell me clearly that you didn't do it?
You honestly cannot recall much of what happened that. You concentrate, but it's no good.
YOU: Look, I'm pretty confident that I'm not the kind of person that would murder someone in cold blood.
EMMA: That's a shockingly evasive answer.
YOU: Weeell. It's only medium evasive.
YOU: Look we're getting off track. We need to gather more information about the victim. 
YOU: Who was the victim?
Emma rolls her eyes. 
EMMA: You're not going to give up are you?
YOU: I'm afraid not.
EMMA: If I tell you what I know about the victim, will you stop pestering me?
YOU: ... 
Emma sighs very deeply. But she does keep talking.
