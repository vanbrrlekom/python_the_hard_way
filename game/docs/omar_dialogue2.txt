YOU: Let's talk about a different topic. 
YOU: Did you have any relationship to Silas?
OMAR: Oh, as a matter of fact. 
OMAR: We were together at Oxford. 
OMAR: The absoulte best of friends.
YOU: So you were here to meet with your old friend?
OMAR: Well, yes. He had invited me here to celebrate the success of his latest business venture.
OMAR: I was thrilled for him. Ecstatic.
YOU: Is that the case? You sound... mildly pleased.
OMAR: Excuse. One of my oldest and best friends is dead.
OMAR: Forgive me if I don't express the proper level of enthusiasm, whatever that is.
YOU: Wow, that's... actually a pretty good point. 
YOU: So you were never jealous of him or anything. 
OMAR: Of course not. Mind you, he never did tell me where all those millions came from.
YOU: And you never thought that was suspcious?
OMAR: Well, I assumed he had invested in some naughty business.
OMAR: YOUPORN, or something of that sort.
OMAR: Not that I know anything about *that*. I mean the YOU--
OMAR: You unerstand what I'm saying, I don't need to say anything else.
You're not sure that you do, but you decide to leave off the topic for now. 
YOU: Tell me, what were you doing at 12 O'clock last night?
OMAR: If you must know, I was in my room, sleeping.
YOU: Alone?
OMAR: As far as I was aware.
YOU: What I'm hearing you say is that you had no alibi at the time.
OMAR: I don't like what you are implying. 
OMAR: I don't believe I need an alibi. 
OMAR: Silas and I were the best of friends, I would have absolutely no reason to kill him.
OMAR: And that's the last I'll say on that topic. 
OMAR: Anything more is a topic for the police, not some amateur sleuthe
OMAR: who was witnessed by multiple people having a row with the victim. 
YOU: Are you sure you don't have anything more to say?
OMAR: My god man, has anyone ever told you that you are obnoxious?
YOU: Surprisingly no.
But you decide not to pursue this line of questioning any further.
