YOU: Do you have any theories on who did?
OMAR: Excuse me. Silas was a good friend.
OMAR: You'll forgive me if I don't participate in this macabre exercise.
YOU: Okay, but what if I really wanted you to. 
YOU: And what if I didn't stop asking.
YOU: It might be the clue that cracks the whole case wide open.
OMAR: I didn't know it was up to you to crack anything open.
OMAR: Let alone this case.
YOU: Come one.
Omar sights.
OMAR: I suppose you won't let up will you?
YOU: That's my strongest trait.
OMAR: Indeed.
OMAR: If you must know, my strongest belief is that you did it.
YOU: Oh come on. What makes you say that?
OMAR: Do I really need to spell it out for you?
OMAR: I heard you arguing. 
OMAR: *Clearly* threatening to kill him.
OMAR: And then there's the matter of that you were *locked in* with Silas.
OMAR: The door was locked. It would have been literally imossible for anyone to come in.
YOU: You don't know that! 
YOU: Maybe there was a secret passage! 
OMAR: I'm afraid that's impossible. 
OMAR: I asked to have a loock at the blueprints earlier.
OMAR: The location of the room very conveniently makes it impossible to construct a secret passage.
OMAR: The only way in and out was through that door. 
YOU: Okay. Okay. Well. Let's just *pretend* you have another theory.
YOU: You're clearly very attached to this whole 
YOU: "I did it" idea. But what if you *had* to come up with an alternative theory?
Omar sights even deeper than before. 
OMAR: Are you telling me that if I make an alternative theory that you'll stop bugging me about this?
YOU: Yes! That's exactly wht I'm saying!
OMAR: All right then. But just to be clear, this is not my favorite theory.
YOU: Yes, yes, I get it. Just tell me your alternative theory.Â¨
OMAR: So, my other theory is that it was Emma and Alma working together.
YOU: Reaaaally? What makes you say that?
OMAR: Two things. Well three things. 
OMAR: First, you're forcing me to choose a theory.
YOU: Well, that.. doesn't really sound like a reaon.
OMAR: Interesting that you would say that. 
YOU: Aaaanyway. You had two more reasons.
OMAR: Their names. They're too similar.
OMAR: I never trust two people who's names are the same. Or very close.
YOU: Em-ma. Al-ma. Doesn't sound *too* similar to me.
OMAR: similar enough to be suspcious.
YOU: And the last reason.
OMAR: I saw them, last night. 
YOU: Interesting. Emma never mentioned anything about that!
YOU: Where?
OMAR: In the parlor. I didn't hear what they were saying, 
OMAR: but they way they were together was... suspcious. 
YOU: That's very interesting. And when was this?
OMAR: I don't remember exactly. Around 9 pm I believe.
YOU: Thank you Omar. That could be the detail that cracks this whole case wide open. 
OMAR: Now will you *please* leave me alone.
YOU: Well, I don't have anything more to say about this specific topic at least.
