Any theories on the murder?

Omar will say his main thoery is that pc did it.
His second theory is that Emma and Alma colluded.
What are his bases for that suspicion? 
1. Their names are too similar. Never trust people with too simlar names.
2. He saw them huddled together, chatting  in the parlor.
When was this?
