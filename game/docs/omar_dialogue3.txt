YOU: Do you have any theories on who did?
OMAR: Excuse me. Silas was a good friend.
OMAR: You'll forgive me if I don't participate in this macabre exercise.
YOU: Okay, but what if I really wanted you to. 
YOU: And what if I didn't stop asking.
YOU: It might be the clue that cracks the whole case wide open.
OMAR: I didn't know it was up to you to crack anything open.
OMAR: Let alone this case.
YOU: Come one.
Omar sights.
OMAR: I suppose you won't let up will you?
YOU: That's my strongest trait.
OMAR: Indeed.
OMAR: If you must know, my strongest belief is that you did it.
YOU: Oh come on. What makes you say that?



Omar will say his main thoery is that pc did it.
His second theory is that Emma and Alma colluded.
What are his bases for that suspicion? 
1. Their names are too similar. Never trust people with too simlar names.
2. He saw them huddled together, chatting  in the parlor.
When was this?
