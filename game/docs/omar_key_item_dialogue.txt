YOU: GOTCHA!!!
OMAR: ??
YOU: You said you were on good terms with Silas, 
YOU: BUT LOOK AT THESE TWEETS!
YOU: You clearly were *not* on good terms. 
Omar has the good grace to look a little put out.
OMAR: Oh, sod it. No point in barking up that tree anymore, is there?
YOU: That's damn straight.
OMAR: I'll admit it.
OMAR: Seems like you caught caught me in a little kosh.
OMAR: Perhpas me and Silas weren't on quite the rosy terms I had made us out to be.
OMAR: But you must understand, 
OMAR: the only reason I didn't tell you is that it
OMAR: would have made me look a damn sight suspicious, wouldn't it?
YOU: Maybe, but how do you think you look now?
OMAR: Fair point. 
OMAR: As it happens, I had invested quite a lot of money in his project,
OMAR: Only to have it all go up in smoke.
OMAR: I wasn't too fussed, what's a few ponies between friends, right?
OMAR: Only, then I heard about these "mysterious millions of his"
OMAR: And he never even mentioned a peep about it.
OMAR: Could have used at least some of those millions to pay me back, couldn't he have?
OMAR: But I wouldn't have murdered him over it!
OMAR: Would have been quite idiotic wouldn't it?
OMAR: I wanted the money. And there was no way he would have given it to me if I had killed him!
YOU: That's a fair point. 
OMAR: And I'll tell you one other thing. 
YOU: Oh?
OMAR: Just to demonstrate the goodness of my character.
OMAR: When I overheard you fighting.
YOU: OH MY GOD, YOU LIED ABOUT THAT TOO? YOU MONSTER.
OMAR: Now hold on. I didn'ty lie a about any of that. 
OMAR: But perhaps I could have told you that I recognize the words you were saying.
YOU: WHAT? THAT BLOWS THIS WHOLE CASE WIDE OPEN.
Omar puts a hand against his ear.
OMAR: You don't have to shout.
OMAR: As I was saying, I recognized the words because I've spoken them myselt many times.
YOU: I KNEW IT! YOU'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF MURDERING YOUR.
Omar sighs.
OMAR: No... if you'll let me finish.
OMAR: I've spoken those words because Silas wrote them.
OMAR: Apparently, he fancies himself quite the dramatist.
OMAR: It's from a play he wrote. 
OMAR: Reorienting on the birder express. 
OMAR: Quite a gruesome tail as a matter of fact. 
YOU: So you did lie!
OMAR: I just... chose to omit that specific detail.
YOU: Shoot. You got me. An omission can never be a lie.
