Even in the dim morning light, you can tell the room is luxuriously luxurious.
The floor is covered in a rich red carpet.
Plush sofas and armchair litter the room.
Through the large windows, you have an excellent view of what looks like a greenhouse outside.
But despite the luxury, the room is also a mess. 
There is a stack of empty bottles sitting on the corner. 
There are large stains on the carpet.
Whoever left the room in this state is going to have right bill to pay.
What happened here?
