Even in the dim morning light, the level of luxury is quite impressive.
The floor is covered in a rich carpet.
Plush sofas and armchair litter the room.
Through the large windows, you have an excellent view of what looks like a greenhouse outside.
But the room is also a mess. 
There is a stack of empty bottles sitting on the corner. 
The furniture has clearly been rearranged, messily and sloppily.
What happened here?
