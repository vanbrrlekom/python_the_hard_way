On one of the shelves in the library, there's a small key made of brass. 
It's simple in design, with a rectangular base and a small loop at the end. 
The key has an old-fashioned look to it, with signs of wear and tear.
 There are scratches and dents on its surface, suggesting it has been used frequently. 
 The key seems to be of medium size, possibly fitting a door or a cabinet. 
 It's not immediately clear what the key unlocks, but it's likely to be significant, given its placement in the library.
The key sits alone on the shelf, 
surrounded by a sea of books, as if waiting for someone to find it.
