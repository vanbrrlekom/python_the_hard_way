TALLOW: What's that you got there?
HORTON: We've also got things y'know. It's not just you.
YOU: What do you think about THIS? 
You show the brothers an item which you are sure to upend the entire case.
TALLOW: That's just some old trinket isn't it?
HORTON: Now if it was valuable, that'd be another thing. We could help you - 
Tallow suddenly elbows his brother in the gut.
TALLOW: Appreciate it. We could help you appreciate it.
HORTON: We're very good at appreciating things! We appreciate all things valuable.
TALLOW: And that's not.
You look at the worthless item in your hand. 
"How could I possibly think this was worth showing the brothers?"
You think to yourself.
