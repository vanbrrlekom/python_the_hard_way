Lying on top of a discarded heap of books, sits a brochure.
"WELCOME TO THE BALLESSNAUGHT CASTLE AND HOTEL!" 
The picture on the hotel depicts a moody, gothic castle set on a backdrop of dramatic highland hills.
Wait a second. 
You walk up to the window.
You look out at the dramatic highland hills.
You look at the picture on the brochure.
You look back out at the dramatic highland hills.
Ohhhhhh.
Weird how alcohol made you forget all that. 
Eh, but you decide to just accept that that is what happened and not think too much about it.
