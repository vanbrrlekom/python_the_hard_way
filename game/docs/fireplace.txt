In one corner of the library, 
a cozy fireplace crackles and pops,
casting flickering shadows across the room. 
The fireplace is made of bricks and mortar,
with a black iron grate inside holding the logs. 
The logs themselves are large and charred, 
radiating warmth throughout the room. 
The flames dance and leap, 
casting a warm and inviting glow over the area. 
You can hear the sound of the wood cracking and popping as it burns. 
The heat from the fireplace is comforting,
and you can feel it radiating outwards. 
The room is filled with the scent of burning wood,
adding to the ambiance of the library. 
A pair of tongs sits on the hearth, 
likely used for rearranging the logs. 
The fire seems to have been recently lit, 
as the logs are still in the process of catching fire. 
It's a perfect spot for curling up with a good book on a cold evening.
