YOU: I think I should make something clear. 
YOU: I'm assuming I did something to you last night.
YOU: But if I did, you must have seen me. I was pretty drunk.
YOU: So whatever I did, I'm really, really sorry. 
YOU: Even if I don't remember exactly what I'm apologizing for.
Both brother stare at you, openly hostile.
TALL BROTHER: What you did, you don't just apologize for.
YOU: But you- 
The other brother interrupts you before you have the chance to say more.
SHORT BROTHER: That's right. You committed murder. That's beyond pale.
TALL BROTHER: Silas was our friend.
SHORT BROTHER: Our very good friend. And you murdered him.
TALL BROTHER: That's just not right.
You're caught of guard for a moment. 
You hadn't expected them to have already have heard about the murder.
And you hadn't expected to be so directly accused. Again.
And then you realize. 
For two brothers who just lost "a very good friend" the two brothers don't look very upset.
Suspicious, hostile, yes, but not upset.
YOU: For having just lost your close friend, you don't seem very upset.
TALL BROTHER: Are you going police our grief now? That's quite some nerve you have there.
SHORT BROTHER: Very nervous! People express grief in different ways, y'know.
TALL BROTHER: If we were bawling our eyes out, clutching our hearts, bedridden from sorrow, would that satisfy you?
SHORT BROTHER: We're grieving here, and all we get from you is demand and suspcioun. That's not right!
YOU: I'm sorry for your loss. I promise you, I didn't kill Silas.
TALL BROTHER: Don't believe you.
SHORT BROTHER: You're a shifty one.
You sigh.
YOU: I didn't want to have to do this, but it seems clear we're not going to get anywhere if I don't.
You show the brothers the letter incriminating Emma.
They read it, slowly, line by line.
TALL BROTHER: Well that's stupid, isn't it?
SHORT BROTHER: Dumbest thing I've ever heard. Eh, but just for this idiot's benefit, what's stupid about it?
TALL BROTHER: If you're going to commit a crime, don't put it in writing. 
TALL BROTHER: Not that we know anytihng about doing crime.
SHORT BROTHER: That's rigth, we know almost everything about doing crime.
The tall brother shoots his short brother and angry look.
SHORT BROTHER: Ehh, I mean we don't know anything at all about doing crime.
SHORT BROTHER: Upstanding citizens, that's us.
YOU: I think this shows that almost anyone can look suspicious.
YOU: I think you should answer my questions now. 
TALL BROTHER: I think you make a fair point.
SHORT BROTHER: It's a fair enough point.
TALL BROTHER: We'll answer your stupid questions.
SHORT BROTHER: I bet your questions are real dumb. 
YOU: And can you *please* tell me your names. 
YOU: I can't keep thinking about you as "TALL" and "SHORT".
TALL BROTHER: What a rude way to ask our names.
SHORT BROTHER: I've never heard anyone ask someone's name so rudely.
TALLOW: But fine. I'm Tallow Mook.
HORTON: Finest thing in the world. I'm Horton Mook.
