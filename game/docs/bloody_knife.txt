The knife is embedded in Silas Vanderhosen's chest,
the handle protruding from between his ribs.
The blade appears to be made of stainless steel and is relatively short,
yet it's still visible from the angle it's plunged into his chest. 
Blood has seeped around the wound, staining his shirt and the carpet beneath him.
The wound itself seems deep,
and the knife looks like it was 
driven into his chest with significant force.
There are no other visible injuries, and it's not immediately clear if any vital organs were hit.
