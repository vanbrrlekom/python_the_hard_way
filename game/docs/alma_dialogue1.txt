YOU: What can you tell me about the victim?
ALMA: Silas Vanderhosen.
ALMA: What.
ALMA: A. 
ALMA: Man.
ALMA: A real daredevil. A real derring-do. A real hopscotcher.
YOU: Eh...
ALMA: I knew him better than almost anyone, I'd say, and I knew him hardly at all.
ALMA: I was his personal physician.
YOU: Did your investigation of the body turn up anything?
ALMA: I'm a glorified GP, not a coroner. 
ALMA: I know he's dead, because he's got no pulse, and I know he was stabbed because of that big gaping hole in his chest.
ALMA: Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.
Hmmm... you think. This was less helpful than you had hoped.
YOU: Did he have any known proclivities for, eh, getting stabbed.
ALMA: You, know if we were talking bout almost anyone else, I'd say:
ALMA: "That's a weird question."
ALMA: But if ever there was a man about whom you'd say:
ALMA: "Ah, I bet he's going to be stabbed one day"
ALMA: It was Silas Vanderhosen.
ALMA: He could be a real arsehole sometimes.
YOU: And how did he and you get along.
ALMA: Oh well enough. I just don't put up with any of his nonsense you know.
ALMA: Sorry, didn't.
ALMA: I would say to him:
ALMA: "Silas, you have to lay of the drinkiing and the smoking and the basejumping, they're bad for your health."
ALMA: At which point he' reply.
ALMA: "No." 
ALMA: And that would be the end of the discussion.
ALMA: With his mysterious millions, no one could really tell him what to do anyway.
YOU: Hold on. Why do you say mysterious?
ALMA: Oh? No one told you? He didn't come from money, you know.
YOU: No?
ALMA: Quite the opposite in fact. 
ALMA: His whole family was dirt poor. 
ALMA: But then, out of nowhwere, he comes into millions.
YOU: Millions of money?
Alma: Millions of good, payable, money.
ALMA: The damnedest thing is, no one could ever figure out where he got it from.
YOU: You think it might have been something illegal?
ALMA: If it was, no one ever got to the bottom of it. 
ALMA: Anyway, as his personal physician I remain obligated to only say nice things about him.
ALMA: So I'm sure it was all above board.
ALMA: And all that was before my time, more than 10 years ago, so I don't know anything about it. 
You make a mental note. This seems to be important.
