YOU: Can you tell me what you saw last night? 
TALLOW: Well, we did see you with Silas in the Orangerie around ten o'clock.
HORTON: Yeah, you were there with Omar, Silas's friend.
YOU: And did you see anything else after that?
TALLOW: Aye, we did. Later that night, we saw you and Silas sneaking around the hotel reception.
HORTON: Yeah, you were trying to be sneaky, but we saw you taking some keys from the reception desk.
YOU: Keys? What kind of keys?
TALLOW: They looked like room keys to us. We assumed you were stealing them.
HORTON: Yeah, and that's not a good look, is it? Stealing keys from a hotel where your friend just got murdered.
YOU: I wasn't stealing them... I don't think. I'm pretty sure I'm not a thief. 
YOU: Silas must have asked me to help him get something from his room.
TALLOW: That's not what it looked like to us.
HORTON: Yeah, it looked like you were up to no good.
YOU: Trust me, I'm not a thief. And I didn't kill Silas.
TALLOW: We'll see about that.
HORTON: Yeah, we'll be keeping an eye on you.
