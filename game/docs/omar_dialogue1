Title: "last night"

PC asks Omar what he remembers of last night.

Omar says the following: he had dinner with everyone at seven.
Like everyone, he was disappointed to note that there wouldn't
be the famous blood pudding.
He observed PC and silas drinking in the orangery at 8.
He was drinking alone in the bar
until 10. 
That was when Silas and PC came back into the main cellar.
PC was yelling at Silas, being very threatening.
Saying things like "if you don't get a hold of yourself, 
I'm going to stab you in the back."
