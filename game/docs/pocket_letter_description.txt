As you examine the corpse, you notice something sticking up out of the pocket.
It's a piece of paper.
Throwing caution and decency to the wind, you lean forward and try to pull it out.
It comes out easy, it's just a piece of paper in a pocket 
it's not like it was wedged in tight or anything.
You unfold the paper and read it. 
It's a letter, scribbled on white paper in small, neat handwriting.
    "Silas, you little piece of shit. 
    I don't care how charming you think you are, your shenanigans have come to an end.
    If you don't pay me back by midnight I'm going to murder you.
    I'm not joking, I'm literally going to murder you.
    You might think to yourself,
    "Emma's always a good for a laugh this is just another on of her little jokes."
    But it's not.
    I'm not joking even a little bit.
    Not one tiny iota.
    So if you or anyone else reading this letter thinks I'm joking,
    banish that thought from your mind.
    I'm going to drag you into the library and stick a knife in your chest.
    So you better pay back that money.
        Your friend Emma
        (whom you owe a lot of money to)"
