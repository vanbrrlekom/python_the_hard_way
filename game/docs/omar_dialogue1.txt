YOU: What do you rmember about last night?
Omar takes a long sip from his whiskey.
OMAR: Well, old, bean, I was wondering when you'd get to that little detail.
OMAR: Unlike some of us, my memory is perfect
YOU: Then you'll have no trouble recounting in precise detail 
YOU: exactly what you were doing and what you saw.
Omar takes another slow sip.
OMAR: Thing is. I don't quite like your tone. 
OMAR: We're all chums here. 
OMAR: But they way you're asking, is making me question your true intentions.
You begin to object, but Omar holds up a hand, silencing you.
OMAR: Now, now. Don't worry. I'll tell you what I remember.
OMAR: I first saw you at dinner, you and Silas seemed to be finding something *very* funny.
OMAR: Starting early, going hard. Tsk. Tsk. 
YOU: Yes, yes, yes. Did you see anything interesting? 
YOU: Anything about the guests?
OMAR: Well, I'll tell you one thing.
OMAR: Dinner was absolutely dreadful. 
OMAR: I'll tell you one thing. 
OMAR: I did notice the good doctor, and that minx Emma 
OMAR: getting awfully chummy with each other. 
OMAR: Suspicuos. If I may say so. 
YOU: Interesting. Anything else?
OMAR: After dinner, I went to my room to refresh.
OMAR: I nipped back down to the orangery for some refreshments.
OMAR: You and Silas were still going at it. 
OMAR: So I decided to come here instead.
YOU: Did you see anything after that?
OMAR: As a matter of fact I did.
OMAR: You and Silas came down. Around ten I believe it was.
OMAR: I didn't stay long, because you were making even more of a racket.
OMAR: In fact, you were having quite a row, as far as I could tell.
YOU: No... That doesn't sound like us.
OMAR: Well that's what I heard.
OMAR: I didn't stay very long.
OMAR: But I distinctly heard you yelling:
OMAR: "if you don't get a hold of yourself,"
OMAR: "I'm going to stab you in the front."
OMAR: You were bing quite viscious, if I may so myself.
Omar grins at you wickedly.
OMAR: "Say, how did the old boy die?"
YOU: We-eell. That's neither here nor there. 
YOU: He died, and we don't need to think much more about that. 
OMAR: Is that so?
