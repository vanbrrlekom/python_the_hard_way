Looking up at the ceiling of the orangery, you see a stunning display of architecture and design. 
The ceiling is high and vaulted, with arched windows and intricate woodwork. 
The wood beams that span the length of the ceiling are exposed and polished to a glossy shine, 
adding a touch of warmth to the space. 
The centerpiece of the ceiling is a large chandelier, 
which hangs down from a decorative medallion in the center.
The chandelier is made of crystal and brass, and it sparkles in the light. 
The chandelier's light refracts off the crystal, casting a soft and warm glow throughout the dining area. 
The ceiling is painted in a pale cream color, 
which complements the woodwork and adds to the overall brightness of the space. 
The ceiling's height and the natural light streaming in through the windows give the dining room an airy and spacious feel, 
making it a perfect place for a leisurely meal.
