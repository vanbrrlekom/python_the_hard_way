This is it. This is the game ending cutscene. 
Silas wakes up and explains how he did it. 
He used the blood from the blood soup.
He got Alma to prescribe him a super strong draugght 
to make him seem asleep. 
He used his knowledge of theater to make the makeup look convincing.
And yes, he did try to frame the main character.
But in his defense, things were going really badly for him.
And he didn't even know you, so it doesn't feel so bad!
