In the corner of the library, 
you notice a handful of small,
sharp glass shards scattered on the floor. 
They are transparent and appear to be from a broken glass object, 
possibly a small cup. 
The shards vary in size, some as small as a grain of sand and others as large as a fingernail. 
The edges of the shards are jagged and sharp, suggesting they broke recently.
The shards are clustered in one area,
and there's no other debris around them.
"Huh," you think to yourself. 
One one of the shards you notice the letters "A.I." engraved.
"This trend of A.I. making everything has really gone too far," you think to yourself.
