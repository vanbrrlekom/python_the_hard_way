You make your way down a narrow staircase, and as you descend, the air grows cooler and damper.
The sound of chatter and clinking glasses grows louder with each step.
Finally, you reach the bottom and step into the Cellar.
The space is dimly lit, with flickering candles casting shadows on the walls.
The atmosphere is cozy, with plush armchairs and sofas arranged around small wooden tables.
A lone man, shortish with a shaved head sits in the corner, nursing a whiskey. 
It must be Omar.
