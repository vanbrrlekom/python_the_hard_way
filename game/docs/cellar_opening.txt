You make your way down a narrow staircase, and as you descend, the air grows cooler and damper.
The sound of chatter and clinking glasses grows louder with each step.
Finally, you reach the bottom and step into the Cellar.
The space is dimly lit, with flickering candles casting shadows on the walls.
The atmosphere is cozy, with plush armchairs and sofas arranged around small wooden tables.
A lone man, shortish with a shaved head sits in the corner, nursing a whiskey. 
He is comfortably draped over one of the plusher armchairs, casually sipping from a whiskey on the rocks.
He is perhaps in his early 30s, dressed in a dapper, if flamboyant suit.
He looks at you like he's been expecting you to talk to him.
???: Ah, there you are. I've been expecting you to talk to me.
YOU: You... you have?
???: Why naturally. There's been a murder, we're the only guests.
???: Anything else would be a derelection of duty, don't yuou think?
YOU: Well I... I thought so but...
You don't quite know what to say.
???: Come here, old bean. Have a seat. The whiskey is perfectly agreeable.
YOU: Um, sorry, but who are you again?
???: You don't remember me. 
???: Of course you don't.
OMAR: I'm Omar. Though we met last night.
As you take your seat, he makes as if to pour a whiskey into an empty glass, before stopping.
OMAR: Though, come to think about it, perhaps not, eh? 
OMAR: You and Silas were being quite naughty last night.
OMAR: Don't you agree?
YOU: I don't know if I'd phrase it quite like that..
OMAR: Oh, come now. Don't be like that. Pouting doesen't suit you.
YOU: I'm not pouting!
OMAR: Have it your way. 
Omar takes another sip from his glass.
OMAR: So, what did you want to talk about?
