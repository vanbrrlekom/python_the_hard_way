EMMA: So, you've decided it was me who did it in the end, have you?
YOU: Yup.
EMMA: And you're sure about that?
YOU: As sure as I've ever been about anything.
EMMA: And what possible motive could I have had?
YOU: It's in the letter! You literally wrote you were going to kill him!
YOU: It doesn't get anymore inculpatory than that!
EMMA: Apart from being in a locked room with the victim.
YOU: Well... Apart from that, yes. 
YOU: But I know I didn't do it!
EMMA: So your memory has returned!
YOU: Well... No. But I have really strong gut feeling that I didn't do it!
EMMA: I see. And can you explain how I did it?
YOU: It's not my job to explain how you did it! 
EMMA: Isn't that convenient?
EMMA: Well, if you really think that's what happend,
EMMA: you can just log off.
YOU: What?
EMMA: I said, you can just sod off.
Indeed. If you're satisfied with your answer, who am I,
the maker of the game, to tell you that you're wrong.
Yet, in your heart, you have this feeling...
Like maybe there is something you've missed. 
Some clue... or combination of clues.
But nah, you can probably live with that.
...
Right?
