EMMA: So, you've decided it was the Mook Brothers who did it in the end, have you?
YOU: They prefer Brothers Mook, actually.
EMMA: Oh.
YOU: It seemed important to them.
EMMA: I'm sure it is.
EMMA: And you're sure it was them?
YOU: Sure as anything. 
EMMA: Okay, walk me through this.
EMMA: Why do you think the... Brothers Mook did it?
It seems like calling the Brothers took some serious effort. 
YOU: Well, for one, they're clearly shady gangsters.
YOU: They pass it off pretty well,
YOU: but I've seen through their act.
EMMA: That... seems pretty thin.
YOU: Then... there is *something* to do with
YOU: building permits... 
YOU: Shady pasts...
YOU: Well, if have to admit, it's a little muddled.
YOU: But there's definitely bad blood. 
EMMA: Okay. So I'll grant that they have a motive.
EMMA: *How* did they do it? How did they get through the doors?
YOU: What do you mean how?
YOU: They're criminals! Of course they have their ways.
EMMA: That's it? That's your explanation?
YOU: What other explanation do you need?
EMMA: I... nevermind. It's clear you're not changing your mind about this.
YOU: I told you, I've nver been as sure about anything!
EMMA: Okay... if you're sure...
Indeed. If you're satisfied with your answer, who am I,
the maker of the game, to tell you that you're wrong?
Yet, in your heart, you have this feeling...
Like maybe there is something you've missed. 
Some clue... or combination of clues.
But nah, you can probably live with that.
...
Right?
So if you're feeling satisfied,
Turn off the game and live your life!
