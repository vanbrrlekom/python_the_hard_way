YOU: What can you tell me about last night?
ALMA: Let me hazard a guess:
ALMA: You don't remember much about last night.
YOU: Well... it's not about *what* you remember, it's about *how* you remember.
ALMA: If I may render my proffessional verdict,
ALMA: I'd say you were shitfaced last night.
YOU: If, uh, we might get back to the victim...
ALMA: Of course, you and Silas both, were at it.
ALMA: If I remember the progression of the evening, we started with dinner at 7pm.
ALMA: You and Silas were already going at it, being, if I may say so, right little shits.
YOU: I'm... sure we had our reasons.
ALMA: I'll tell you the reason: alcohol. 
ALMA: If I may give some proffessional advice, I'd say: 
ALMA: "You better lay off that drink friend." 
ALMA: If you want to remember your evenings in the morning at least.
YOU: Did you see me or Silas at any other point in the evening.
ALMA: I did. I saw the two of you in this very room. 
You look around at the messy room, guiltily.
ALMA: I was sitting by myself, trying to read a book.
YOU: And what were we doing.
ALMA: You two were being a menace. 
ALMA: I had to leave, it was impossible to stay in there.
YOU: Do you remember anything we talked about.
ALMA: Now that you ask, I do remember hearing something about about a knife.
ALMA: And something else about a stabbing.
ALMA: As I'm thinking about it, that's really quite suspicious, isn't it?
YOU: I'm the one investigating this murder, *you* don't really have to think too hard about it.
Alma narrows here eyes. Is she growing more suspicious of you?
YOU: Ehhh-nyway. Did you see either Silas or the two of us at anyt other point that evening.
ALMA: I did not. After that, I went to my room. 
ALMA: This morning, I got a text from Emma telling me to come down to the library, sharpish.
YOU: What I'm hearing you say is, you have no alibi.
ALMA: And why, exactly, would I need an alibi?
YOU: No one can be above suspicion
ALMA: Oh? The way I heard, it, you were found with the victim in a room that was locked from the inside.
ALMA: And you're hands are still covered in blood. 
YOU: Uh...
You make a mental note to wash your hands the next time you get the chance.
ALMA: I'd say you're pretty suspicious yourself.
YOU: Like I said, I'm the one doing the investigating, I'll make sure to look into all of that.
YOU: Tell me this: When was the last time you spoke to the victim?
ALMA: Well, that was actually right before dinner. 
ALMA: He insisted I prescribe him a set of sleeping pills.
YOU: And what did you tell him?
ALMA: I refused. I said he'd had enough of that stuff. He didn't like that.
ALMA: Wouldn't say another word to me for the rest of the night.
YOU: It sounds like quite the falling out. 
ALMA: It was nothing like that. Silas was always like that. 
ALMA: One moment he'd be your best friend, the next he'd be down your throat.
ALMa: And that's all I have to say about that.
