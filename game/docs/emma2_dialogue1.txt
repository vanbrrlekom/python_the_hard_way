EMMA: So, you've decided it was Omar who did it in the end, have you?
YOU: Yup.
EMMA: And you're sure about that?
YOU: Sure as anything. 
EMMA: Okay, walk me through this.
EMMA: Why do you think Omar did it.
YOU: Well, he's a dirty liar, that's for one.
YOU: I'm sure he lied about everything. 
EMMA: I see...
YOU: Specifically, about how Silas didn't give him money.
YOU: The two of them were NOT getting along. 
EMMA: And you think it was bad enough that Omar wanted to kill over it?
YOU: I don't think it. I know it!
EMMA: Okay. But how!
YOU: That's easy. He had no Alibi. He admitted it himself!
EMMA: Not quite what I was asking.
EMMA: You still haven't accounted for the locked door.
YOU: Loocked doork, locked shmoor. 
YOU: If there is a spare key, it would have been easy.
EMMA: The key was in the room the whole time. 
EMMA: And there was no spare key!
YOU: Hmm...
YOU: Eh, who knows what keys are!
EMMA: Okay. Well, if you're convinced...
YOU: There's no unconvincing me!
Indeed. If you're satisfied with your answer, who am I,
the maker of the game, to tell you that you're wrong.
Yet, in your heart, you have this feeling...
Like,
maybe there is something you've missed. 
Some clue...
... or combination of clues.
But nah, you can probably live with that.
...
Right?
