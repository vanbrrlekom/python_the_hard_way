Wedged under one of the armchairs is a curious looking paper.
You pick it up.
"One always benefits from more scraps of paper,"
You think to yourself.
Then, to your surprise, you see the paper has written notes on it.
It's in color too!
"Someome truly spared no expense on this,"
you think to yourself.
Huh, it's a series of tweets, printed out.
You read them out.
It seems to be a conversation between two people.
@smooth_operator, as far as you can tell,
uses a profile picture of a bald man in a garish suit
holding what looks like a TED talk.
Oh wait, no it's just a TEDx talk.
The other tweeter, @by_the_pants, has a picture of charlie brown.
You read the tweets.
@smooth_operator: Okay, so I'm drunk. They say never post drunk. But fuck it. What is the point of this useless bird site if not to burn bridge?
@smooth_operator: Never trust anyone with a dutch last name. They are all inherently backstabbing little sneaks.
@van_berlekom: WTF BRO???
@smooth_operator: Except you. You're the best.
@van_berlekom: <3
@smooth_operator: Most of the time.
@van_berlekom: :Â´-(
@smooth_operator: Okay, since I've been inundated with questions, I'll just come out and say it.
@smooth_operator: I'm talking about Silas Vanderhosen.
@smooth_operator: That guy is a used piece of toilet paper. And I'm not talking about a number one.
@smooth_operator: He's a piece of -redacted-, that's what I'm saying.
@by_the_pants: Okay, what the fuck?
@smooth_operator: Oh NOWWW you want ot talk????
@by_the_pants: You need to shut this down whatever it is you think you're doing. Call me and we'l sort this out.
@smooth_oprator: No -redacted- YOU! If you -redacted- want -redacted- a hot toster and - redacted-
The print ends
