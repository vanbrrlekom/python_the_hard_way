Emma takes the letter.
She reads it slowly and carefully.
She looks up at you.
She looks down at the letter.
She looks back up at you.
EMMA: I will admit, this does not looks good for me.
EMMA: But you have to believe me, I truly was only joking.
EMMA: Yes, I know I got weirdly specific towards the end there.
EMMA: But...
EMMA: That's just how we joke! Me and Silas, we're like that.
EMMA: How could I have known he was going to end up dead just the way it was written in that letter?
EMMA: ...
YOU: ...
EMMA: Don't look at me like that.
EMMA: And anyway. The library was locked from the inside!
EMMA: How could I have possibly committed the murder?
You look at the letter, very pointedly.
EMMA: Come on, you must admit, things do not look good for you either. 
EMMA: How about, instead of throwing senseless accusations at each other, we work together?
EMMA: And by work together, I mean, I'll wait here while you talk to the other guests.
EMMA: Some of them are shifty as heck.
EMMA: I'll unlock the doors for you. 
EMMA: You should MOVE to a different room see who you can find.
EMMA: When you have a plausible theory, come back and find me and we'll talk it out.
