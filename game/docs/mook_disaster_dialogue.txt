YOU: What do you make of this damning evidence?
TALLOW: Let me see that.
HORTON: That's a piece of paper, unless I'm very much mistaken
YOU: That's right.
TALLOW: Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
HORTON: Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Tallo looks like he is about to say something, but holds his tounge in the end.
TALLOW: I see what this is.
HORTON: You're showing us something visible.
TALLOW: That's right brother. 
Tallow winks.
HORTON: You're one of us. 
TALLOW: A human.
HORTON: That's... sure. That too. Don't worry, you're secret's safe with us. 
You go about you're day, relieved that your extraordinary trust in the brothers was not misplaced.
Then, just as you are about to crack the case wide opens.
WHEEE OOOHH WHEEEE OOOH WHEE OOOH
Sirens! 
It's the cops!
Seems like the brothers spilled the beans about your confession in the end.
Why, um, why did you think showing them that was a good idea?
Well, game's over. You spend the rest of your life in prison for a murder that you
*probably* didn't commit.
Well done.
