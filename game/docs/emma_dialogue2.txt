YOU: Who was this anyway?
EMMA: Poor Silas.
Silas... That name does ring bell. 
You remember chatting with him at dinner.
You got on quite well.
You can't really remember any single thing he said, but you have the sense that you had a good time.
The splitting headache in your head says *something* about the time you had.
YOU: Silas... Silas, silas, silas.
You look at him. Lying there on the ground, books strewn all around.
YOU: You know, I have decided that Silas didn't deserve to die like that.
YOU: Not alone, in a shoddy library, and not without anyone ever knowing how it happened. 
YOU: Yes. I'm going to solve the murder and clear my good name. 
EMMA: First, he wasn't alone, you were clearly there. Second, this is quite a fancy library.
EMMA: Lastly, there is no muderer *to* solve. You clearly killed him.
YOU: Well... You... you don't know that!
EMMA: Can *you* tell me clearly that you didn't do it?
You honestly cannot recall much of what happened that. You concentrate, but it's no good.
YOU: Look, I'm pretty confident that I'm not the kind of person that would murder someone in cold blood.
EMMA: That's a shockingly evasive answer.
YOU: Weeell. It's only medium evasive.
YOU: Look we're getting off track. We need to gather more information about the victim. 
YOU: Who was the victim?
Emma rolls her eyes. 
EMMA: You're not going to give up are you?
YOU: I'm afraid not.
EMMA: If I tell you what I know about the victim, will you stop pestering me?
YOU: ... 
Emma sighs very deeply. 
EMMA: Who was the victim? Where to start...
*Imagine some very dramatic music here*
EMMA: Silas Vanderhosen. What a man. He was a millionaire, you know.
EMMA: You wouldn't expect it, looking at him, but that's Silas for you.
YOU: How did you know him?
EMMA: We're good friends, him and I. Met at college. 
EMMA: He always said he was going to change the world.
EMMA: He was a hard man to get along with, but somehow, he and I always seem to manage just fine.
YOU: When was the last time you saw him?
EMMA: It was in the parlor. Around 9 p.m. I believe.
YOU: And what was he doing?
EMMA: He was talkig to you, as a matter of fact. The two of you hit it off rather famously.
You try to remember last night.
You do have bits of memory, a vague notion of spending time with Silas...
But it's all very blurry and imprecise. 
YOU: Did you hear what we were talking about?
EMMA: Surely *you* would have heard what you were talking about.
YOU: Ahem... I'm just trying to understand exactly what happened. 
EMMA: I did not catch any of the specifics, but you were being rather loud.
YOU: And then what happened?
EMMA: Then I came here, to pick up a book before heading back to my room.
EMMA: This morning, I came to give it back and that's when I found the door locked.
You: Why did you break the door in? Seems a bit much.
EMMA: There was a bloody handprint.
YOU: A bloody handprint on the door? Seems a little suspicous.
EMMA: Yes! That's why I had to break the door down.
YOU: And do you have an alibi for what you were doing between 9pm and this morning?
EMMA: I don't NEED an alibi. You were here, with the murderer, in a locked room, with the key inside.
YOU: But where *you*?
EMMA: All right. I've humored this line of questioning long enough.
EMMA: It's clear you can't be reasonable about this.
EMMA: I've said all I have to say on this matter.
