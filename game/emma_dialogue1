YOU: Why did you tell me not to move.
EMMA: I would have thought it was obvious.
YOU: ...

EMMA: Come on. You are here all alone with poor Silas,

YOU: That doesn't prove anything! Maybe I was trying to save him!
EMMA: Were you?
You try to remember the events of last night. It's all still a blur.

YOU: I could have been!
Emma narrows her eyes, looking very suspicously at you.
EMMA: That's a very muderer-like thing to say, you know.
YOU: I'm not a murderer!
YOU: ... I don't think.
EMMA: My god. You really don't remember what happened last night at all, do you?
YOU: What's memory but a social construct anyway?

YOU: Maybe we can investigate this together. Emma and me, dynamic due. Solving crimes!
EMMA: If you think I'm letting you walk around here on your own, you've got another thing coming.
