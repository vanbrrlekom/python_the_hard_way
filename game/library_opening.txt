Press enter to continue.
*Knock knock knock*
What's going on? Your head is pounding. 
You blink, trying to shake the sleep out of your eyes.
*Knock knock knock*
That's not your head, that's... that's coming from outside.
You stand up, groggily. Weird, your hands are so...
Sticky.
No. Not sticky. They're bloody.
You try to think back to the night before.
You remember...
A drink. 
And another drink.
Quite a lot of drinks actually.
There was...
A lot of people you don't know.
You remember entering the library, knocking over some books.
Ah, yes, you look around.
You are still in the library.
And the books are there, on the floor,
Right where you left them.
And what is that red puddle next to it?
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
With a last, final
*CRASH*
The door opens.
A woman in a red dress, with long flowing hair spills in.
        EMMA: Dear god. It's too late.
        YOU: Wha...?
        EMMA: You thought you could get away with it while we were all sleeping.
        YOU: Get away with...?
        EMMA: Don't move.
You follow Emma's gaze.
Your eyes move past the puddle. *More blood* you realize.
Up and then you see it.
The body.
It's definitely dead. It's very bloody. 
It looks like a man in his 50s, with a very bald head and a very big mustache.
And then you look at your hands again.
*Oh,* you think.
What the hell happened last night?
