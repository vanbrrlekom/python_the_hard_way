Press enter to continue. You can also type other stuff, but it, uh, doesn't do anything. 
Later, you'll get to enter numbers.
Now, we'll start the game.
*Knock knock knock*
What's going on? Your head is pounding. 
You blink, trying to shake the sleep out of your eyes.
*Knock knock knock*
That's not your head, that's... that's coming from outside your head.
You stand up, groggily. Weird, your hands are so...
Sticky.
No. Not sticky. They're bloody.
That seems... bad.
You try to think back to the night before.
You remember...
A drink. 
And another drink.
Quite a lot of drinks actually.
There was...
A lot of people you don't know.
You remember entering the library, knocking over some books.
Ah, yes, you look around.
You are still in the library.
And the books are there, on the floor,
Right where you left them.
And what is that red puddle next to it?
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
With a last, final
*CRASH*
The door opens.
A woman in a red dress, with long flowing hair spills in.
You know her. She's... Emma Atalle. She's one of the guests.
        EMMA: Dear god. It's too late.
        YOU: Wha...?
        EMMA: You thought you could get away with it while we were all sleeping.
        YOU: Get away with...?
        EMMA: Don't move.
You follow Emma's gaze.
Your eyes move past the puddle. *More blood* you realize.
Up and then you see it.
The body.
It's definitely dead. It's very bloody. 
It looks like a man in his 50s, with a very bald head and a very big mustache.
And then you look at your hands again.
*Oh,* you think.
What the hell happened last night?
You consider your choices.
In your brain-fog, you don't have a good sense of your surroundings. It might be a good idea to LOOK AROUND.
Emma has seems to have some idea what's going on. Maybe you should TALK to her.
Or maybe you should try to INVESTIGATE the crime scene, to find some proof of your innocent. You feel... pretty sure that you are innocent.
Emma doesn't seem inclined to let you leave the room. Perhaps if you PRESENT her with the right item, she will be more inclined to help.
