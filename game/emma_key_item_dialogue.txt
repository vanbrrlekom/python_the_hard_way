Emma takes the letter.
She reads it slowly and carefully.
She looks up at you.
She looks down at the letter.
She looks back up at you.
EMMA: I will admit, this does not looks good for me.
EMMA: But you have to believe me, I truly was only joking.
EMMA: Yes, I know I got weirdly specific towards the end there.
EMMA: But...
EMMA: That's just how we joke!
EMMA: And anyway. The library was locked from the inside!
EMMA: How could I have possibly committed the murder?
EMMA: And you must admit, things do not look good for you either. 
EMMA: How about, instead of throwing senseless accusations at each other, we work together?
EMMA: And by work together, I mean, I'll wait here while you talk to the other guests.
EMMA: Some of them are shifty as heck.
